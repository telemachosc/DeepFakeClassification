# DeepFakeClassification
Classify your deep fakes. 


I implement an autoencoder for classification based on the paper of [C. Xing, L. Ma, and X. Yang, “Stacked Denoise Autoencoder Based Feature Extraction and Classification for Hyperspectral Images,” J. Sensors, vol. 2016, p. 3632943, 2016](https://doi.org/10.1155/2016/3632943).

The classification accuracy on the test set is 70%.
